This service should have a main method: processUserQuery(userMessage)

Pipeline Steps:
1. interpretQuery(userMessage)
   - Understand user intent
   - Validate query relevance (only environmental/climate queries)
   - Extract locations and analysis type
   - Return: query_type, locations, is_relevant

2. validateRelevance(interpretation)
   - Check if query is about: flood, urban, deforestation, or air pollution
   - If irrelevant: return fallback response with suggestions
   - If relevant: continue to next step

3. identifyLocationsWithCoordinates(interpretation)
   - Geocode location names to coordinates
   - Use geocoding API (we'll integrate this next)
   - Return array of locations with lat/lon

4. performAnalysis(queryType, locations, userMessage)
   - Gather environmental data from APIs
   - Send to Gemini for comprehensive analysis
   - Return: metrics, risk_level, recommendations

5. generateMapVisualizationData(locations, analysis)
   - Create markers (pins) for locations
   - Create radius circles for affected areas
   - Return: center, zoom, markers, circles

The main processUserQuery() method should:

   - Return friendly fallback message

2. Fallback message should include:
   - Title: "I'm a Climate & Disaster Intelligence Assistant"
   - Explanation: Why the query is not relevant
   - Suggestions: 3-4 example queries user can try
   - Examples for all 4 cases: flood, urban, deforestation, air_pollution

3. Update the interpretQuery() method to return:
   ```json
   {
     "is_relevant": true/false,
     "relevance_explanation": "...",
     "query_type": "flood_analysis" or "irrelevant",
     "fallback_suggestion": "..." (if irrelevant)
   }
   ```

Please provide the updated validation logic and fallback response generation.
```
